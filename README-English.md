# COVID 19 Confirmed Cases Analysis
Based on a guided project on Coursera almost 3 years ago, I have decided to revisit the analysis and add some of my own questions that arose from my curiosity about how the situation in my country, Ecuador, unfolded during the pandemic. *Project in progress.

## Technical Details
### About the Dataset
For this project, I used data on daily confirmed total COVID-19 cases from January 22 to April 30, 2020, from all countries worldwide, in CSV format (Available in this repository). The data was obtained from Coursera Project Network.

### About the Language and Environment
Jupyter Labs in Anaconda was used as the environment for conducting the analysis, with Python as the programming language. The file is in .ipynb format.
Libraries used: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, datetime, calendar

## What Do I Want to Discover with This Analysis?
I aimed to focus this analysis on Ecuador's situation during the early months of the pandemic, intending to identify:
- The evolution of daily confirmed total cases from January to April.
- The evolution of daily new confirmed cases within 24 hours during the same period.
- How Ecuador's daily infection rate compares with other countries in Latin America.
- How this same parameter compares with other countries worldwide.
- The top 10 countries that recorded the highest number of new confirmed cases within 24 hours worldwide.
- Additional data on when and how much the peak of infections occurred for a particular country.

## Key Findings
## What's Next?
I plan to further expand this analysis by adding the following elements:
- Comparison with other factors such as happiness indices by country, GDP per capita, etc.
- Comparison of the number of daily confirmed total cases with the number of daily confirmed deaths, and see how much the top 10 changes on a global level.
